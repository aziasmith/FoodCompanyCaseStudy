# Food Delivery Company Menu Consolidation & Brand Identity Case Study
Case study project for Google data analytics course

# Background
A food delivery company operates out of multiple cities across the country. They have various fulfillment centers that prepare and distribute the meals that are ordered. They have a wide variety of cuisines and 51 menu items that are offered. They currently offer four different cuisines (Italian, Thai, Indian, and Continental) which makes it difficult to have a solid brand identity. The marketing team would like to establish two cuisines in order to market the brand better. 

# Business Task
In order to simplify the menu and establish the brand identity, I have been tasked to identify which cuisine types and meals are most popular. 

# Data Source
This case study is being done by using a [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kannanaikkal/food-demand-forecasting) from Kaggle that was originally published by Edwin U Kannanaikkal.
